# [Statistically Preconditioned Accelerated Gradient Method for Distributed Optimization](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/hendrikx20a/hendrikx20a.pdf)

### Problem Statement:
This research deals with the challenge of distributed empirical risk minimization. It focuses on situations where multiple machines calculate gradients at the same time, and a central server updates model parameters. The main problem is to reduce the number of communications needed to reach a specific level of accuracy in this context.

### Importance:
Efficient distributed optimization is highly important in modern machine learning applications, especially when handling large datasets spread across several machines. Reducing communication overhead while maintaining accuracy is crucial for achieving efficient distributed learning.

### Examples of Occurrence:
This issue arises in scenarios where a large dataset is divided among multiple machines, like in the distributed training of machine learning models. The recurring problem is the need to minimize communication rounds while optimizing the global model in these settings.

### Authors' Approach:
The authors suggest a method using preconditioned accelerated gradients to address this problem. Preconditioning is done by solving a local optimization problem on a subset of the dataset at the server. The method's convergence rate depends on the square root of the relative condition number between the global and local loss functions. They estimate this relative condition number for linear prediction models by studying the uniform concentration of Hessians over a limited domain. This allows them to derive improved convergence rates for both existing preconditioned gradient methods and their newly introduced accelerated method.

### Basis of the Approach:
The approach is based on preconditioned gradient methods and the concept of condition numbers. It builds on previous research in distributed optimization, with a particular focus on communication efficiency.

### Key Features of the Proposed Methods:

The approach uses statistical preconditioning to reduce communication complexity.
It provides more accurate bounds on the relative condition number, improving the convergence rates for existing and newly introduced methods.
The authors utilize the smoothness and strong convexity of the reference function to enhance convergence.
Intuition for Success:
The success of the approach lies in efficiently reducing communication rounds between machines while optimizing the global model. By using statistical preconditioning and obtaining better bounds on the condition number, the authors achieve faster convergence and more efficient distributed optimization.

### Improvements Over Previous Literature:
The authors' approach offers several enhancements over existing literature:

It achieves improved convergence rates for both existing preconditioned gradient methods and their new accelerated method.
It provides better bounds on the relative condition number, reducing communication complexity.
Empirical results demonstrate the advantages of acceleration, particularly in ill-conditioned scenarios, where it outperforms previous literature.
