Problem Statement:
The research paper tackles a problem related to structured convex optimization. It focuses on scenarios where the objective function can be divided into three parts: one that's convex and strong, another that's smooth and convex, and a third that's smooth but possibly not convex. The primary aim is to create an effective method to solve these types of optimization problems.

This research is important because it addresses a class of optimization problems that are widely applicable in distributed systems and machine learning. The proposed methods have the potential to significantly reduce the communication and computation complexity involved in distributed optimization, which can have a major impact on the efficiency and scalability of such systems.

Examples of Occurrence:

Federated Learning: In federated learning, multiple devices or agents collaborate to train a global machine learning model without sharing their local data. The goal is to minimize a global objective function, which can be decomposed into a sum of local loss functions, where each agent has its own local dataset. The problem of aggregating these local gradients and updating the global model can be seen as an instance of the structured convex optimization problem discussed in the paper.

Decentralized Control: In decentralized control systems, multiple agents or sensors need to cooperate to optimize a common objective function, which can be decomposed into components related to individual agent dynamics, costs, or constraints. The proposed optimization methods can be applied to enhance the efficiency of these decentralized control systems.

Main Idea of the Authors' Approach:
The main idea of the authors' approach is to design an inexact accelerated gradient sliding method for solving structured convex optimization problems. This method skips the gradient computation for one of the components of the objective function while still achieving optimal complexity of gradient calls for the other components. The proposed algorithm is designed to work with objective functions that are a sum of three components: a (µ-strongly) convex component, a smooth and convex component, and a smooth but possibly non-convex component. The key innovation is that the algorithm can skip the gradient computation for the non-convex component, which is often more computationally expensive.

Basis of the Approach:
The authors build upon existing research in the fields of structured convex optimization, distributed optimization, and gradient sliding methods. They leverage the principles of convexity and function similarity to design their algorithm. Their approach extends gradient-sliding techniques, which were originally developed for convex cases, to non-convex components.

Key Features of the Proposed Methods:

Inexact Accelerated Gradient Sliding: The proposed methods incorporate an inexact acceleration approach. They use gradient-sliding techniques to skip the computation of the gradient for the non-convex component while preserving the optimal complexity of gradient calls for the other components.

Optimal Complexity: The proposed methods achieve optimal complexity of gradient calls for the smooth convex and (µ-strong) convex components of the objective function. This means that the number of gradient calls is minimized, which is crucial for efficiency in distributed systems.

Customization for Function Similarity: The approach is customized to address scenarios where the agents have function similarity. In cases where the Hessian matrices of local loss functions are similar, the proposed methods take advantage of this similarity to further reduce communication and computation complexity.

Application to Distributed Optimization: The research extends its methods to distributed optimization problems over master-worker architectures. The authors achieve lower complexity bounds on both communication and local gradient calls in these distributed settings.

Intuition for Success:
The success of this approach lies in the effective utilization of the principles of convexity and function similarity. By carefully designing a gradient-sliding algorithm that can handle non-convex components, the authors reduce the computational burden associated with distributed optimization. Moreover, the customization for function similarity allows for additional efficiency gains. These methods aim to balance the trade-off between communication and computation complexity, which is critical in distributed settings.

Improvements Over Existing Literature:

Sharper Complexity Bounds: The proposed methods achieve sharper complexity bounds compared to existing approaches, especially when there is a significant difference between the smoothness of convex and non-convex components.

Optimal Complexity: The research provides methods that are more computationally efficient, reducing both communication and computation complexity. In some cases, this is the first time that such optimal bounds have been achieved.

Customization for Function Similarity: The approach customizes the methods to scenarios with function similarity, offering further improvements in communication efficiency.

Non-Convex Components: Unlike many existing approaches, the research addresses scenarios with non-convex components in the objective function, which significantly expands the applicability of the methods.

In summary, this research advances the field of distributed optimization by providing more efficient methods that handle a wide range of objective functions, including those with non-convex components. It extends these methods to scenarios with function similarity and achieves optimal complexity bounds.
