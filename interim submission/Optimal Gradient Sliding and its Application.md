# [Optimal Gradient Sliding and its Application to Distributed Optimization Under Similarity](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/d88f6f81e1aaf606776ffdd06fdf24ef-Paper-Conference.pdf)

### Problem Statement:
The research paper focuses on addressing structured convex optimization problems with additive objectives, composed of three elements: a (µ-strongly) convex component, a smooth convex component, and a smooth, possibly nonconvex component. The main problem involves developing an inexact accelerated gradient sliding method that can selectively skip gradient computations for the nonconvex component while maintaining optimal gradient computation complexity for the other components. This approach seeks to enhance the efficiency of solving distributed optimization problems, especially in cases where the computational cost of evaluating gradient components differs significantly.

### Importance:
This research is crucial for distributed systems and machine learning applications. It offers the potential to significantly reduce communication and computation complexity in distributed optimization, enhancing system efficiency and scalability.

### Examples of Occurrence:

Federated Learning: Collaborative training of machine learning models by multiple devices or agents, minimizing a global objective derived from local datasets.
Decentralized Control: Cooperative optimization in systems with multiple agents or sensors.
Authors' Approach:
Designing an inexact accelerated gradient sliding method for structured convex optimization. This method skips gradient computation for the non-convex part while maintaining optimal complexity for other components. It works for objective functions comprising a (µ-strong) convex, a smooth convex, and a smooth non-convex part.

### Basis of the Approach:
Leveraging prior research in structured convex optimization, distributed optimization, and gradient sliding methods. Adapting gradient-sliding techniques originally developed for convex problems to non-convex components.

### Key Features of the Proposed Methods:

Inexact Accelerated Gradient Sliding: Incorporates inexact acceleration and gradient sliding, specifically for the non-convex component, preserving optimal complexity for other components.
Optimal Complexity: Achieves optimal complexity for gradient calls in smooth convex and (µ-strong) convex components, reducing the number of gradient calls.
Customization for Function Similarity: Adapts to function similarity scenarios, further reducing communication and computation complexity.
Application to Distributed Optimization: Extends methods to distributed optimization, achieving lower complexity in communication and local gradient calls.

### Improvements Over Previous Literature:

Sharper Complexity Bounds: Offers sharper complexity bounds, especially when convex and non-convex components greatly differ.
Optimal Complexity: Provides more computational efficiency, reducing both communication and computation complexity.
Customization for Function Similarity: Tailors methods for function similarity scenarios, enhancing communication efficiency.
Handling Non-Convex Components: Uniquely addresses non-convex components in the objective function, broadening applicability.
